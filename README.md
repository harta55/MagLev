# MagLev
This Android application is the merged final version of the Magnetic Levitation Android application developed at the University of Connecticut under Dr. Savas Tasoglu and ultimately published in "Smart-phone attachable, flow-assisted magnetic focusing device". 

This application is responsible for controlling a motor through BLE technology, imaging magnetically separted particles, and processing these images through OpenCV libraries
